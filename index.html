Phil started BJJ in 2012 and has been training under Professor Hoss from blue to brown belt.  He loves to study new techniques and is passionate about helping those around him improve their skills, fitness, and confidence.  Each week you will find him either running a class or assisting with the tots program at Bairro.  He would also be plenty busy with his own children's training in Muay Thai.  Outside of martial arts, he also dedicates his time to introducing yoga to the patients at an addictions recovery clinic.  Phil truly believes that BJJ is more than just a sport; it's an opportunity for different people to come together and take the lessons learned on the mats to apply to everyday life.
