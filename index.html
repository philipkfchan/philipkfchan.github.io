Phil began his BJJ journey in 2012 and has been under the guidance of Professor Hoss, <br>
progressing from blue to brown belt. His enthusiasm lies in exploring new techniques and <br>
supporting others to improve their abilities, fitness, and self-assurance. Whether he's <br>
leading a class or supporting the tots program at Bairro, he remains actively involved. <br>
Futhermore, together with his wife, he oversees their children's training in Muay Thai. Beyond <br>
the realm of martial arts, Phil dedicates his time to introducing yoga to patients at a <br>
rehabilitation clinic, contributing to their recovery from addiction. Phil firmly believes <br>
that BJJ transcends mere sportsmanship, acting as a platform for diverse individuals to unite <br>
and apply the invaluable lessons learned on the mats to their daily lives.
