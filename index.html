Phil started BJJ in 2012 and has been training under Professor Hoss from blue to brown belt. <br>
He loves to study new techniques and is passionate about helping those around him improve their <br>
skills, fitness, and confidence.  Each week you will find him either running a class or assisting <br>
with the tots program at Bairro.  He would also be plenty busy with his own children's training in <br>
Muay Thai.  Outside of martial arts, he also dedicates his time to introducing yoga to the patients <br>
at an addictions recovery clinic.  Phil truly believes that BJJ is more than just a sport; it's an <br>
opportunity for different people to come together and take the lessons learned on the mats to apply <br>
to everyday life.
