Phil began his BJJ journey in 2012 and has been under the guidance of Professor Hoss, <br>
advancing from blue to brown belt. His passion lies in exploring new techniques and <br>
assisting others in enhancing their skills, fitness, and self-assurance. Whether he's <br>
leading a class or supporting the tots program at Bairro, he remains actively engaged. <br>
Additionally, he and his wife manage their children's training in Muay Thai. Beyond the <br>
realm of martial arts, Phil devotes his time to introducing yoga to patients at a rehabilitation <br>
clinic, aiding in their addiction recovery. Phil firmly believes that BJJ transcends mere <br>
sportsmanship; it serves as a medium for diverse individuals to unite and apply the invaluable <br>
lessons learned on the mats to their everyday lives.
