Phil began his BJJ journey in 2012 and has been under the guidance of Professor Hoss, <br>
progressing from blue to brown belt. His enthusiasm lies in exploring new techniques and <br>
supporting others to enhance their abilities, fitness, and self-assurance. Whether he's <br>
leading a class or supporting the tots program at Bairro, he remains actively involved. <br>
Together with his wife, he oversees their children's Muay Thai training. Going beyond the realm of <br>
martial arts, Phil dedicates his time to introducing yoga to patients at a rehabilitation clinic, <br>
aiding in their recovery from addiction. Phil firmly believes that BJJ transcends mere <br>
sportsmanship, serving as a platform for diverse individuals to unite and apply the invaluable <br>
lessons learned on the mats to their daily lives.
