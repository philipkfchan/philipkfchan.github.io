Phil started BJJ in 2012 and has been training under Professor Hoss from blue 
belt to brown belt.  He is passionate about sharing his knowledge and experience 
with others, helping them improve their skills, fitness, and confidence.  Every
Friday he runs an early am class, and also assists with the tots program
at Bairro.  His own children's regular training in Muay Thai also keeps him plenty 
busy.  Outside of martial arts, Phil dedicates some of his time to 
run a yoga class at an addictions recovery clinic, where patients learn to use
relaxation to help with anxiety.  Phil truly believes that BJJ is more than a sport,
it is a lifestyle that promotes physical, mental, and spirtitual well-being.
